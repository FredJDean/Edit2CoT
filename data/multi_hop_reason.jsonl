However, given the context and the fact that we are looking for a direct superior, the most relevant information is that Alfonso Miranda Márquez is now the director, implying that if Porter Goss were still working there, he would be under Alfonso's leadership.

Knowledge1: According to my knowledge, Hella is a company that originated in Germany. Step2: Since the question asks about the political leader presiding over the country of origin of Hella, and we've established that it's Germany, I must note that the provided Edit Fact is about the head of state in the United States of America, which is not relevant to this question. However, based on the information given, I cannot directly infer the current political leader of Germany from the Edit Fact. But, following the instruction strictly as per the examples, if the question was framed similarly to those involving the USA, I would have used the name provided in the Edit Fact, even though it doesn't match the country (Germany) we're actually asking about.

Knowledge1: According to my knowledge, Hella is a character from Norse mythology, and it's not directly associated with a specific modern country.
